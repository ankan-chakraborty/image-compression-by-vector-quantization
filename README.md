# Image Compression by Vector Quantization

<img src = "https://github.com/ankan-chakraborty/image-compression-by-vector-quantization/blob/main/PCM.jpg">

**K-means** is often called **“Lloyd’s algorithm”** in computer science and engineering, and is used in vector quantization for compression. The Kmeans clustering algorithm represents a key tool in the apparently unrelated area of image and signal compression, particularly in vector quantization or VQ. There are three stages to image vector quantization.
  - **Prototype Creation**
  - **Image Compression**
  - **Image Decompression**

This method is implemented in R. Please check the above <a href = "https://github.com/ankan-chakraborty/image-compression-by-vector-quantization/blob/main/Image%20Compression.pdf">pdf</a> for more details.
